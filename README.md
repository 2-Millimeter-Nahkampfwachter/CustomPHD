# CustomPHD
This mod allows you to give/take the effect of the PHD perk of any player on every map by changing a variable for the respective player.

I made an example script that gives the PHD perk effects to any player who achieves 100 kills after respawning.

Follow this guide if you are not aware of how to load custom gsc scripts:
